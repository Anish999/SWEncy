SWEncy, as the name suggests, is a Star Wars Encyclopedia. It is a read only website as of now, yet to be hosted on the cloud. It is written with JavaScript using React. It is using SWAPI, an online API for all the Star Wars data, for the backend. There are some features that are working and some more that I am working on. Here’s a list of few of them.

Features:
	‘People’ page for displaying all the characters from the movie series
	‘Planets’ page for displaying all the planets’ information
	SWAPI integration for continuous data fetching
	Semantic UI for better UI
	Cards to display lists, they can be flipped to learn more about particular item
	Pagination at the bottom of the pages that have more than a page long (i.e 10 items) data/cards
	Parallax integrated Home page with clickable links to People and Planets Page
	A simple Navigation Bar for easy routing and navigation

Future Goals:
	Node.js backend integration
	Mongo dB for saving information
	Users login and authentication to get the personalized views and favorites
	Add Favorites button to each card for logged in users
	More tabs like ‘Films’, ‘Starships’, ‘Vehicles’, etc.
	Dynamic Image binding for each card, unique to object ID
	‘Summary’ and ‘Clips’ section for people who want to read/watch particular scenes 

Running the project on your device:
	As far as I can tell, you wouldn’t have to worry about the backend Node.js project because it will be hosted and the API will be available within the React project
	First of all, you need to have Node.js installed on your computer.
	To check the version, just go to the command line and type; node –v 
	Npm should be installed already, you can check, just to be sure: npm –v
	Once they’re installed, the environment setup is basically done 
	Now clone/ download the project from Github 
	You can open the project with any IDE you like, I prefer VS Code
	Now go to the project directory from the terminal and type: npm install
	This installs all packages needed to run the project
	Once installed, type: npm start and you’re good to go
	There shouldn’t be any problems, but if there occurs any, shoot me an email at manandhar58@gmail.com

Enjoy!
